<h2>The Plot</h2>

<p>It all begins at Stoneybrook Middle School, when Mallory’s teacher, Mr. Doughtery, announces that there is going to be the a special day called Young Authors Day. On that day, students can participate in contest. That contest is all about writing a story of a kind they choose. When Mal (short for Mallory) heard about that contest, she got to work. But the problem is that, in Mal’s house there are LOTS of kids. Mal needs to finish her homework, help out her mom, go to BSC meeting and then work on her story.
She needs to work really fast on her homework.When it comes to BSC meeting, Kristy is really stricked about it. When someone is late for a BSC meeting, Kristy is unhappy for the rest of the day.Mal works as quick as she can, but she is late for the meeting.At the meeting, Mal doesn’t take many good jobs.
When Mal goes home, she tries to work at her story, but her mom keeps calling Mal to help her. Day after, Mal’s after school  class, Mr.Doughtery’s creative writing class, begins. Mr.Doughtery, said that he will call out people and tell him about the story they wanted to write. When Mr.Doughtery called out Mallory, she had written only three paragraphs! Mr.Doughtery was disappointed. But, Mal promised Mr.Doughtery that she will write more.</p>

  
<p>On Friday, when another meeting was, Mal told whole club that she wanted more free time, and if club doesn't leave her alone, she will quit.On weekend, Mallory told herself that she will work on her story.She even gave her sister (who lived with Mal) money to stay away from the room.But, her mom kept draging her out of her room.The next weekend, Mal made a special sign that said ”Mallory on Strike”.That sign meant that when someone distracts Mallory, she will be out of patience. The strike was like in baseball game.
The next day, Mallory goes to the shopping mall with Jessi (short for Jessica).When it comes to Young Authors day, Mal was so nervous.But, luckily she won in the category she choosed.Best overall fiction for sixth grade.
Then, everything was back to normal.
Mallory even made a special day for her siblings.Then Mallory realized how important her siblings were.</p>

    
<h2>I really recommend this book for those who have younger siblings. Maybe it will teach them how important family is.</h2>
